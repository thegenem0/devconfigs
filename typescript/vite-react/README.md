# Vite-React Config files

This assumes using the following:

- typescript
- vite
- vitest
- eslint
- prettier
- husky
- lint-staged
- mock-service-worker

## Setup

1. Initialize a standard vite project:

2. Copy the contents of this repo into the root of your repo.

3. Make the compiler happy by installing the deps it needs.

_Note_: `package.json` is provided as reference for scripts and other configs.
You probably shouldn't copy it over as is.
